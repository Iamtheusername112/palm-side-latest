## 📱 How It Works in Real Life

### Scenario: Customer submits form at 3:00 PM

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Form is saved to database *(always happens)*
2. ✅ Customer sees success message
3. ✅ Email sent to admin@palmside.es
4. 📧 **Admin's phone buzzes** with new email
5. 📱 Admin opens email on phone
6. 👀 Admin reads the full message
7. 💬 Admin can:
   - Reply directly from phone email app
   - OR tap "View in Dashboard" for full details
   - OR deal with it later (it's saved in database)

### Benefits:
- ⚡ **Instant response**: No need to check dashboard constantly
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly**: Works on phone, tablet, laptop

- ✉️ **Easy replies**: Respond right from your email
- 🔄 **Backup**: Even if email fails, it's in the database

## 🚀 Optional: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)

For better email deliverability and professionalism:

1. [ ] In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. [ ] Click **Add Domain**
3. [ ] Enter: `palmside.es`
4. [ ] Add DNS records (Resend will show you what to add):
   - SPF record
   - DKIM record
   - DMARC record (optional)
5. [ ] Wait for verification (usually 5-15 minutes)
6. [ ] Once verified, emails will come from `notifications@palmside.es`

**Without domain verification:**
- Emails come from `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Still works fine, just less professional
- Might have slightly lower deliverability
