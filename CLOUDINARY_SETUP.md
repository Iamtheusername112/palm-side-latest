# ☁️ Cloudinary Setup for Production Image Uploads

## 🚨 Why This is Needed

The previous image upload system saved files to the local filesystem (`public/uploads/`), which **doesn't work in production** because:

- ❌ Filesystem is read-only on Vercel/Netlify
- ❌ Files get deleted on each deployment
- ❌ No CDN for fast image delivery

**Cloudinary solves all of these issues!** ✅

---

## ✅ What Changed

- ✅ Images now upload to **Cloudinary** (cloud storage)
- ✅ Works in **both development and production**
- ✅ **FREE tier**: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month
- ✅ **Automatic image optimization**
- ✅ **CDN** included for fast loading
- ✅ Can upload up to **50 images**, **50MB each**

## 🎯 Setup Instructions (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account (2 min)

1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Click **"Sign Up for Free"**
3. Use email or Google/GitHub login
4. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get Your API Credentials (1 min)

1. Log into your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. You'll see your credentials on the main dashboard:
   ```
   Cloud Name: your_cloud_name
   API Key: 123456789012345
   API Secret: abc123xyz789...
   ```
3. **Copy these** - you'll need them next!

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables (1 min)

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration (for production image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name_here"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret_here"
```

**Example:**
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="palmside-properties"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="123456789012345"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="AbC123XyZ789..."
```

### Step 4: Add to Production Environment (1 min)

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add all three variables:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
4. **Redeploy** your application

**For Other Platforms:**
Add the same three environment variables to your hosting platform's environment configuration.

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing:

1. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/properties`

3. **Add/Edit a property** and upload images

4. **Check Cloudinary**:
   - Go to [cloudinary.com/console/media_library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library)
   - You should see uploaded images in `palmside/properties/` folder

### Production Testing:

1. **Deploy your app** with the environment variables
2. **Upload images** through admin panel
3. Images should appear immediately
4. Check browser dev tools - image URLs should be `res.cloudinary.com/...`

---

## 📁 Image Organization

Images are organized in Cloudinary as:

```
palmside/
  └── properties/
      ├── 1234567890_abc123.jpg
      ├── 1234567890_xyz789.png
      └── ...
```

You can view/manage them in your [Cloudinary Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Images not uploading"

1. ✅ Check environment variables are set correctly
2. ✅ Verify credentials are correct (no extra spaces)
3. ✅ Restart server after adding env vars
4. ✅ Check Cloudinary dashboard quota (free tier limits)

### "Invalid credentials" error

- Double-check `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, and `API_SECRET`
- Make sure there are no quotes or spaces
- Verify you're using the correct Cloudinary account

### "Upload fails in production"

- Verify environment variables are set in production
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify Cloudinary account is active

### "Images not showing"

- Check image URLs in database
- Verify they start with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- Try opening the image URL directly in browser

---

## 📊 Monitoring Usage

Check your Cloudinary usage:

1. Go to [cloudinary.com/console](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. View dashboard for:
   - Storage used
   - Bandwidth used
   - Transformations used
   - API calls

Set up alerts when approaching limits!

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep API secrets in environment variables
- Never commit `.env.local` to git
- Use different accounts for dev/production (optional)
- Regularly rotate API keys

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share API secrets publicly
- Commit secrets to GitHub
- Use same credentials across projects
- Ignore usage alerts

---

## 🚀 Migration from Local Storage

### For Existing Images:

If you have images in `public/uploads/properties/`:

1. **They still work locally** (won't break existing setup)
2. **Upload new images** - they'll go to Cloudinary
3. **Optional**: Manually upload old images to Cloudinary
4. **Optional**: Update database URLs to Cloudinary URLs

### No Breaking Changes:

- Old local images still work in development
- New images go to Cloudinary
- Gradual migration possible
