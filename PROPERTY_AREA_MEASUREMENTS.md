# 📐 Property Area Measurements - New Features

## ✅ What Was Added

Three new measurement fields have been added to the property upload system to provide detailed area information in square meters (m²).

---

## 🎯 New Fields

### 1. **Plot Size (m²)**
- **Description**: Total plot or land area
- **Field Name**: `plotSizeM2`
- **Unit**: Square meters (m²)
- **Example**: 500.00 m²
- **Usage**: The total size of the land/plot where the property is located

### 2. **Built Area (m²)**
- **Description**: Total built-up area
- **Field Name**: `builtAreaM2`
- **Unit**: Square meters (m²)
- **Example**: 350.00 m²
- **Usage**: The total constructed area including all floors, walls, and structures

### 3. **Living Space (m²)**
- **Description**: Usable living space
- **Field Name**: `livingSpaceM2`
- **Unit**: Square meters (m²)
- **Example**: 280.00 m²
- **Usage**: The actual usable interior space (excludes walls, structures, garages, etc.)

---

## 📊 Field Relationships

```
Plot Size (m²)  ≥  Built Area (m²)  ≥  Living Space (m²)

Example:
Plot: 500 m²  (Total land)
Built: 350 m² (Total construction)
Living: 280 m² (Usable interior space)
```

**Logic:**
- **Plot Size** includes the entire land (gardens, driveways, etc.)
- **Built Area** is everything constructed on the plot
- **Living Space** is the interior space you can actually live in

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### **Villa Example:**
- **Plot Size**: 1,200 m² (includes gardens, pool area, driveway)
- **Built Area**: 450 m² (house structure, garage, terraces)
- **Living Space**: 320 m² (bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathrooms)

### **Apartment Example:**
- **Plot Size**: N/A or 0 (shared building land)
- **Built Area**: 95 m² (including balcony, walls)
- **Living Space**: 78 m² (interior usable space)

### **Commercial Property:**
- **Plot Size**: 2,500 m² (entire property land)
- **Built Area**: 1,800 m² (all buildings and structures)
- **Living Space**: 1,500 m² (office/commercial space)

## 🌍 Why Square Meters?

**Square meters (m²)** is the international standard for measuring property area, especially in:
- Europe (Spain, Germany, France, etc.)
- Most of the world outside the USA
- Professional real estate listings

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Standardized globally
- ✅ Easier for international clients
- ✅ Professional presentation
- ✅ Matches local regulations (Spain uses m²)

**Note:** The system still supports **Square Feet** for compatibility with US clients.

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly

All three fields work perfectly on:
- 📱 Mobile phones
- 📱 Tablets
- 💻 Desktop computers
- 🖥️ Large screens

The form automatically adjusts layout based on screen size.

### **Technical Details:**

```sql
Column Name: plot_size_m2
Type: NUMERIC(10, 2)
Allows: 0.00 to 99,999,999.99
Nullable: Yes (optional)

Column Name: built_area_m2
Type: NUMERIC(10, 2)

## 🎨 Display on Website

These measurements will be displayed on property listings and details pages alongside other property information.

**Example Display:**
```
📐 Area Measurements
Plot: 850 m²
Built: 320 m²
Living: 265 m²
```

---

## 🔄 Migration

### **For Existing Properties:**

Properties created before this update will have these fields empty (null). You can:
1. Edit each property individually to add measurements
2. Or leave them empty if measurements are unknown

### **Database Migration:**

A migration script has been created:
- **File**: `migrations/add_area_measurements.sql`
- **Action**: Adds three new columns to the properties table
- **Safe**: Uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` (won't break existing data)
